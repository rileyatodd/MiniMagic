          give requirements for animation
               need correct amount of frames
               no more than 3 can be the same (must actually be moving)
          send them to a specific email

      Spells

      Respecs
        Have a bank of available skills you can switch freely while out of combat for a nominal exp fee
          Increasing size of skill bank gets increasingly very expensive
          Max skill bank capped at 1/2 total skills in game
        Have to drop a skill if skill bank is full

Only one gear slot
   Focus (weapon)
      Color specific bonuses or slightly stronger class specific bonuses
      Other interesting bonuses
         More like trinkets than stat sticks


To Do:
    Fix Auto-attack - implement as class specific spells
      generalize to a method for characters
    Clean up Activity.onCreate()
    Create a way to store and load player profiles
      Player profile class 
        Basically just a save state of character spells, exp, items,
      Character.loadProfile()
        invoke in character.<init>()
          Make character.<init> require a profile to be passed to it?
    User Interface
      Pause Menu
        Character Pane
          main tab
            Concept Art
            Current Stats
          exp tab
            Stat Slider

            Spell Bank
              Bank above the bar
              drag and drop
      Spell Error (e.g. out of range) feedback
      Display health bars as arcs around characters
    Graphical
      Use Drawable Animation for the animations
        Define image sequence in xml
